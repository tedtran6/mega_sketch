This was a super big arduino project that mashed two different kinds of MIDI controllers together. One made from a potentiometer clock and one from a capacitor keyboard. The capacitor keyboard is played by tapping on the wires that were taped onto the table. The clock was played by moving clockwise an arm on the clock. A different arm on the clock selected the samples that were played. 
## notes:
This one took a lot more effort to do. The first issue I had was getting the clocks to move the potentiometers. Since the hands arenâ€™t solidly attached to the axles, I tried to glue them down to the axels but it never worked. I tried clamping the grove of the second hand down with glue onto the axle but that didn't work either ( however it worked for a day ), and I even tried burning the groove of the axle with a candle but it turns out that the groove was made of plastic so I could've easily broken it by trying to bend it with the nail clippers too. The potentiomters can move relatively smoothly (except the minute hand, but that's understandable)
### things to work/improve on: 
organization, creating new methods, and creating constants when needed ( I dropped a lot of magic numbers )

below are some images and videos

I don't know where the video went that demonstrated me actually playing this instrument, sorry!
